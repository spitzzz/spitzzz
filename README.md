# Hello, I'm Chris 👋

I have notable experience in the cloud space ☁️ (12x AWS Certified, 1x Azure Certified), and as you may have guessed by now - I'm passionate about about cloud computing, writing infrastructure as code, automation, and continuous deployment. Any opinions you may find on my profile(s) are my own.

## Feel free to give me a follow 🙂

... I like to think I'm pretty friendly 👀
